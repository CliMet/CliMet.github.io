I am a PhD student working with CliMet Group led by Profeesor Hui Su at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, with a focus on investigating the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and climate change. My research approach combines observation, modeling, and statistical methods to gain insights into the complexity of the ITCZ and models' performance. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of climate science and making meaningful contributions to society through my research.
